## Obtaining the Solace API

This tutorial depends on you having Solace Node.js API version 10 or later downloaded and available. Here are a few easy ways to get the Node.js API. The instructions in the Running the Samples section assume you're pulling the packages from the `npmjs` public repository. If your environment differs then adjust the instructions appropriately.

The API Reference is available online at the [Node.js API documentation]({{ site.docs-api-reference }}){:target="_top"}.

### Get the API: Using the npmjs repository

This will locate and download compatible library packages from the `npmjs` public repository using the local `package.json` specs.

```
npm install
```

### Get the API: Using the Solace Developer Portal

The Solace Node.js API distribution package can be [downloaded here]({{ site.links-downloads }}){:target="_top"}. Install the included tar.gz tarball package named `node-solclientjs-<version>.tar.gz`:
	
```
npm install <path_to_tarball_directory>/node-solclientjs-<version>.tar.gz 
```
