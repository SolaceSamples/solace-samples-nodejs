This tutorial outlines both roles in the request-response message exchange pattern. It will show you how to act as the client by creating a request, sending it and waiting for the response. It will also show you how to act as the server by receiving incoming requests, creating a reply and sending it back to the client. It builds on the basic concepts introduced in [publish/subscribe tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/publish-subscribe).

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes the following:

*   You are familiar with Solace [core concepts]({{ site.docs-core-concepts }}){:target="_top"}.
*   You have access to Solace messaging with the following configuration details:
    *   Connectivity information for a Solace message-VPN
    *   Enabled client username and password

{% if jekyll.environment == 'solaceCloud' %}
One simple way to get access to Solace messaging quickly is to create a messaging service in Solace Cloud [as outlined here]({{ site.links-solaceCloud-setup}}){:target="_top"}. You can find other ways to get access to Solace messaging below.
{% else %}
One simple way to get access to a Solace message router is to start a Solace VMR load [as outlined here]({{ site.docs-vmr-setup }}){:target="_top"}. By default the Solace VMR will with the “default” message VPN configured and ready for guaranteed messaging. Going forward, this tutorial assumes that you are using the Solace VMR. If you are using a different Solace message router configuration adapt the tutorial appropriately to match your configuration.

## Goals

The goals of this tutorial are to understand the following:

*   On the requestor side:
    1.  How to create a request
    2.  How to receive a response
    3.  How to use the Solace API to correlate the request and response
*   On the replier side:
    1.  How to detect a request expecting a reply
    2.  How to generate a reply message

## Overview

Request-reply messaging is supported by the Solace message router for all delivery modes. For direct messaging, the Solace APIs provide the `Requestor` object for convenience. This object makes it easy to send a request and wait for the reply message. It is a convenience object that makes use of the API provided “inbox” topic that is automatically created for each Solace client and automatically correlates requests with replies using the message correlation ID. (See Message Correlation below for more details). On the reply side another convenience method enables applications to easily send replies for specific requests. Direct messaging request reply is the delivery mode that is illustrated in this sample.

### Message Correlation

For request-reply messaging to be successful it must be possible for the requestor to correlate the request with the subsequent reply. Solace messages support two fields that are needed to enable request-reply correlation. The reply-to field can be used by the requestor to indicate a Solace Topic where the reply should be sent. A natural choice for this is often the unique `P2PINBOX_IN_USE` topic which is an auto-generated unique topic per client which is accessible as a session property. The second requirement is to be able to detect the reply message from the stream of incoming messages. This is accomplished using the `correlation-id` field. This field will transit the Solace messaging system unmodified. Repliers can include the same `correlation-id` in a reply message to allow the requestor to detect the corresponding reply. The figure below outlines this exchange.

For direct messages however, this is simplified through the use of the `Requestor` object as shown in this sample.

{% include solaceApi.md %}

## Implementing Request/Reply

This tutorial’s sample code comes as two separate applications: one (with the “requestor” object) send requests to a specific topic and the other (with the “replier” object) subscribes to requests on that topic, receives the requests and replies on them.

The structure of the requestor application is similar to the publish/subscribe tutorial's topic publisher. Here instead of simply publishing a message, a request will be sent.

The structure of the replier application is similar to the topic subscriber. It differs in that when receiving the request it doesn't only log the message but sends a reply.

The followings are exactly the same as in the [publish/subscribe tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/publish-subscribe), refer to it for all the detailed descriptions.
    
* Loading and Initializing Solace Node.js API
* Connecting to the Solace message router
* Session Events

### Making a request

First let’s look at the requestor. This is the application that will send the initial request message and wait for the reply.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Request-Reply_diagram-2.png)

The requestor must create a message and the topic to send the message to:

```javascript
var requestText = 'Sample Request';
var request = solace.SolclientFactory.createMessage();
request.setDestination(solace.SolclientFactory.createTopicDestination(requestor.topicName));
request.setSdtContainer(solace.SDTField.create(solace.SDTFieldType.STRING, requestText));
request.setDeliveryMode(solace.MessageDeliveryModeType.DIRECT);
```

Now the request can be sent. Notice callbacks `replyReceivedCb` and `requestFailedCb`. These are functions that will be called when a reply message is received (`replyReceivedCb`) or sending the request fails (`requestFailedCb`).

```javascript
try {
    requestor.session.sendRequest(
        request,
        5000, // 5 seconds timeout for this operation
        function (session, message) {
            requestor.replyReceivedCb(session, message);
        },
        function (session, event) {
            requestor.requestFailedCb(session, event);
        },
        null // not providing correlation object
    );
} catch (error) {
    requestor.log(error.toString());
}
```

### Replying to a request

Now it is time to receive the request and generate an appropriate reply.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Request-Reply_diagram-3.png)

Just as with previous tutorials, you still need to connect a session and subscribe to the topics that requests are sent on (the request topic). The following is an example of such a reply.

```javascript
replier.reply = function (message) {
    if (replier.session !== null) {
        var reply = solace.SolclientFactory.createMessage();
        var ba = message.getBinaryAttachment();
        var replyText = message.getSdtContainer().getValue() + " - Sample Reply";
        reply.setSdtContainer(solace.SDTField.create(solace.SDTFieldType.STRING, replyText));
        replier.session.sendReply(message, reply);
        replier.log('Replied.');
    } else {
        replier.log('Cannot reply: not connected to Solace message router.');
    }
};
```

The replier.reply is the function that is called from the replier message event listener defined for `replier.session`:

```javascript
// define message event listener
replier.session.on(solace.SessionEventCode.MESSAGE, function (message) {
    try {
        replier.reply(message);
    } catch (error) {
        replier.log(error.toString());
    }
});
```

### Receiving the Reply Message

All that’s left is to receive and process the reply message as it is received at the requestor or report a failure:

```javascript
requestor.replyReceivedCb = function (session, message) {
	requestor.log('Received reply: "' + message.getSdtContainer().getValue() + '"');
};
requestor.requestFailedCb = function (session, event) {
	requestor.log('Request failure: ' + event.toString());
};
```

## Summarizing

Combining the example source code shown above results in the following source code files:

<ul>
{% for item in page.links %}
<li><a href="{{ site.repository }}{{ item.link }}" target="_blank">{{ item.label }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

### Getting the Source

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Solace samples.

```
git clone {{ site.repository }}
cd {{ site.repository | split: '/' | last}}
```
 
Note: the code in the `master` branch of this repository depends on Solace Node.js API version 10 or later. If you want to work with an older version clone the branch that corresponds your version.

### Installing the Node.js API

For a local installation of the API package, run from the current `{{ site.baseurl | remove: '/'}}` directory:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Samples

The samples consist of two separate requestor and replier Node.js applications in the `/src/basic-samples` directory: _(BasicRequestor.js_ and _BasicReplier.js)_.

The publisher application publishes one message and exits, the subscriber application is running until Ctrl-C is pressed on the console.

**Sample Output**

First run `BasicReplier.js` in Node.js, giving it following arguments:

```
node _BasicReplier.js <host:port> <client-username> <client-password> <message-vpn>
```

The following is the output of the tutorial’s _BasicReplier.js_ application after it successfully connected to the Solace message router and subscribed to the request topic.

```bash
$ node BasicReplier.js ws://192.168.133.64 testuser@default passw
[14:52:10]
*** replier to topic "tutorial/topic" is ready to connect ***
[14:52:10] Connecting to Solace message router using url: ws://192.168.133.64
[14:52:10] Client username: testuser
[14:52:10] Solace message router VPN name: default
[14:52:10] Press Ctrl-C to exit
[14:52:10] === Successfully connected and ready to subscribe to request topic. ===
[14:52:10] Subscribing to topic: tutorial/topic
[14:52:10] Successfully subscribed to request topic: tutorial/topic
[14:52:10] === Ready to receive requests. ===
```

Now, run _BasicRequestor.js_ in Node.js, also specifying the same arguments.

It will connect to the router, send a request, receive a reply and exit.

The following is the output of the tutorial’s _BasicRequestor.js_ application after it successfully connected to the Solace message router, sent a request, received a reply and exited.

```bash
$ node BasicRequestor.js ws://192.168.133.64 testuser@default passw
[14:52:16]
